# Example Model Output: VIC

Model output generated by MESH in NetCDF format. 

Most important sections of the header accessible through, for example, `ncdump -h` are the following. Please be aware that this is only parts of the header; sections that are not important here are not displayed.
```
ncdump -h example/input_MESH/DRAINSOL_H_GRD.nc
netcdf DRAINSOL_H_GRD {
dimensions:
	rlon = 9 ;
	rlat = 16 ;
	time = UNLIMITED ; // (43824 currently)
variables:
	float longitude(rlat, rlon) ;
		longitude:standard_name = "longitude" ;
		longitude:units = "degrees_east" ;
	float latitude(rlat, rlon) ;
		latitude:standard_name = "latitude" ;
		latitude:units = "degrees_north" ;
	int time(time) ;
